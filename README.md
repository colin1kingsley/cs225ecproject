# Team Contract

## Communication
### Team meetings ###
Our team will meet once per week through a Discord video call to discuss the work that each of us have been doing on the project. The calls will be approximately 30 minutes or less. The time and date of each week's video call will be determined via group chats on the group Discord server.

### Assistance
All inter-team communication will be conducted through Discord, in the Discord server the group has established. 

Each week, a different group member will be in charge of taking notes on the meeting. There are 5 group members. For each of the first 5 weeks, one group member who has not previously taken notes will volunteer to take notes for that week's meeting. 

This process will repeat for the remaining set of 5-week periods comprising the rest of the project working period. 

For example:

---

Week 1: Member B\
Week 2: Member C\
Week 3: Member A\
Week 4: Member D\
Week 5: Member E
 
---

Week 6: Member C\
Week 7: Member E\
Week 8: Member D\
Week 9: Member A\
Week 10: Member B

---

etc.

### Respect
Every team member pledges to respect the ideas, comments, and input of all other team members in all formats, including while communicating on Discord, communicating on a video call, or communicating and interacting in-person. Any team member is allowed to communicate via Discord at any time, and other team members are pledge to voice their responses respectfully. 

If a team member is being disrespectful, other team members reserve the right to contact the CS 225 course staff to determine next steps. 

All group members pledge to respectfully address and respond to the ideas, questions, and concerns of other group members to the best of their ability. 

Every group member pledges to genuninely and thoroughly consider the ideas and thoughts of all other group members.


## Colaboration
### Work distribution
At each weekly team meeting, the group will collaboratively assign tasks to each group member to be completed before the beginning of the next week's meeting. 

Each group member will be given a chance to voice their thoughts about what they would like to work relative to their strengths, weaknesses, and interests, and also relative to what they think is fair for themself and the rest of the group. 

After prospective work assignments (tasks) have been decided for each group member for the coming week, each group member will have a chance to voice whether or not they think the work allocation is fair and, if not, how they would like to change it.

### Time Commitment
Each group member will be expected to work approximately 2 hours per week. This time may vary depending on the amount of time required for the team member to complete their assigned task.

### Conflict Resolution
If there is a disagreement between course members, the following general strategy will be used for conflict resolution:

1. Each group member will explain their perspective thoroughly and respectfully via Discord chat, video call, or at an in-person meetup.
2. Each group member will respond thoughtfully and respectfully to the perspective of the other group member.
3. If the disagreement is not resolved, the group will vote as a whole on which course of action to take, or how to resolve the disagreement. The majority vote will determine the course of action to be taken, and all disagreeing parties will respectfully abide by this chosen decision.
4. If the disagreeing parties or group, for whatever reason, has difficulty executing this conflict resolution strategy, or the disagreement is escalating, or the disagreeing parties are acting or continuing to act unreasonably and/or in the opinion of one or more group members, a group member or members can reach out to the course staff for assistance with conflict resolution.

The following are resolutions for more specific scenarios:

- If a group member is habitually late: all other group members will meet and decide what course of action to take. It is within the right of these other group members to reach out to the course staff, and potentially ask for the group member to be removed from the group.

- If a group member is continually being disrespectful, argumentative, or noncooperative with the group: the group will reach out to the course staff.

- In other situations: the group will attempt the conflict resolution strategies detailed here, but if unsuccessful in resolving conflicts or issues with the behavior of a group member or members, will reach out to the course staff.
